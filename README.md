# Awesomidi

This project was bootstrapped with Electron React Boilerplate [Create React App](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Run

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## DevTools

#### Toggle Chrome DevTools

- OS X: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>
- Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>
- Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>

*See [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug) for more information.*

#### DevTools extension

This boilerplate is included following DevTools extensions:

* [Devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) - Install via [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug).
* [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).
* [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

You can find the tabs on Chrome DevTools.

If you want to update extensions version, please set `UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS` env, just run:

```bash
$ UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 npm run dev

# For Windows
$ set UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 && npm run dev
```


## Externals

If you use any 3rd party libraries which can't or won't be built with webpack, you must list them in your `webpack.config.base.js`ï¼š

```javascript
externals: [
  // put your node 3rd party libraries which can't be built with webpack here (mysql, mongodb, and so on..)
]
```

For a common example, to install bcrypt, `npm i --save bcrypt`, and make sure to list bcrypt in externals in `webpack.config.base.js` or the app won't include them in the package:
```js
externals: ['bcrypt']
```


## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

#### Options

See [electron-builder CLI Usage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#cli-usage)

#### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#two-packagejson-structure).

1. If the module is native to a platform or otherwise should be included with the published package (i.e. bcrypt, openbci), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json` and `externals` in `webpack.config.base.js`.   See [Externals](#externals).
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`.   See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md).
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

## Static Type Checking
This project comes with Flow support out of the box! You can annotate your code with types, [get Flow errors as ESLint errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors), and get [type errors during runtime](https://github.com/gcanti/babel-plugin-tcomb-boilerplate) during development. Types are completely optional.

## Native-like UI

If you want to have native-like User Interface (OS X El Capitan and Windows 10), [react-desktop](https://github.com/gabrielbull/react-desktop) may perfect suit for you.
